Description: CNI plugin to provide name resolution for containers
 This CNI plugin sets up the use of dnsmasq on a given CNI network so
 that Pods can resolve each other by name. When configured, the pod and
 its IP address are added to a network specific hosts file that dnsmasq
 reads in. Similarly, when a pod is removed from the network, it will
 remove the entry from the hosts file. Each CNI network will have its own
 dnsmasq instance. The dnsname plugin was specifically designed for the
 Podman container engine.
